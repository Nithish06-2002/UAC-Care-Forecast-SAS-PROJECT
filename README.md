Predictive Forecasting of UAC Care Load (SAS)

Project Overview

This project performs time-series forecasting and machine learning prediction on the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Program dataset from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

The objective is to forecast short-term care demand and identify capacity risk using statistical and ML models.
